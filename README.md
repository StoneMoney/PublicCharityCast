# CharityCast
A tool for charity fundraising livestreams. Integrate with ExtraLife for responsive totals. Check out the wiki!


## Information for users
CharityCast is a free tool! Spreading the word is appreciated, but not required! Customized versions of the omnibar are rather simple to impliment, but I may also open a service to commission one instead.
